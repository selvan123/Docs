Hi, I’m Selvan. I bring over 21 years of experience in the IT industry with a strong foundation in the Microsoft ecosystem. I started my career as a .NET developer and later transitioned into cloud by leading application modernization and migration projects to Microsoft Azure.

My DevOps journey began with Visual Studio Team Services (now Azure DevOps), where I got hands-on with setting up end-to-end CI/CD pipelines. Over time, I specialized in DevOps transformation initiatives—conducting DevOps maturity assessments, identifying process and tooling gaps, and defining actionable roadmaps for continuous improvement.

My core focus areas include implementing enterprise-scale branching and merging strategies, onboarding DevOps toolchains, integrating static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST), container security, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like Bicep, ARM, and Terraform, as well as monitoring and observability with tools like Azure Monitor and Splunk.

I’ve also implemented DevSecOps best practices, containerization using Docker and Kubernetes, and integrated quality gates and shift-left security into CI/CD workflows. I track and drive improvements using DORA metrics like deployment frequency, lead time for change, change failure rate, and MTTR.

In recent engagements, I’ve supported several GitHub migration projects. In my latest assignment, I successfully led the migration of over 350+ repositories from Azure DevOps to GitHub, ensuring secure, scalable, and automated workflows with GitHub Actions, GitHub Advanced Security, and inner-source adoption."

Let me know if you’d like to condense this into a 30-second version or format it into a formal profile bio.
