Project Description
Over the years, WBEI systems have been replaced by alternate systems for various reasons including: upgrading to newer, modern architectures, as well as consolidating systems from acquisitions (e.g. New Line Cinema).  However, while the majority of the functionality of these systems was replaced on a go-forward basis, in many cases some functionality as well as historical data was not entirely migrated into the new system.  In these cases, the legacy systems continue to be maintained as the “system of record” for historical data to support any reporting (e.g. statutory or legal) that require this data.  In addition, some systems continue to play a part in the current system landscape and may be accumulating additional data.
The WBEI Archive Reporting Portal (ARP) is an initiative to create a custom archival reporting system for WBEI, storing imaged report documents (such as reports in PDF format and MS Office documents) and a Data Mart to allow for ingestion of data from WBEI legacy systems.

The goals of the overall project are:
•	To provide cost effective, self-service access to historical structured and unstructured (e.g. PDF or images) data currently maintained in aging legacy systems of record
•	To reduce support costs by migrating this data to a new, centralized, reporting system while:
1.	Complying with record retention policies
2.	Supporting legal, statutory and participations research requirements

	This is multimillion project and close to 20 (JGL, BGL, ORFIN, JTF, ITS, HP 3000, JPA, DMT, DOF, IFP, IPG, etc.,) applications were migrated to ARP solution as part of this project in various phases
